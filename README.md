# COMP7160-project
This is a course project.
The data is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog?select=training_set). The processed data (split into training set, validation set and test set) could be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlgUvqARjQxV5VgD1cT_GMrb_ZyvDor6/view?usp=share_link.

To reproduce the results, you just need to download the zipped dataset file from google drive and the code in the GitHub. Put the zipped file and the code in the same folder and then unzip the dataset file. After that, you could run the code and the results will be plotted.
